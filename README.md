Netflix Data Engineering

A data engineering project that builds a structured data pipeline to ingest, process, and transform Netflix streaming data into analytics-ready formats using configurable pipelines and notebooks.

 Project Overview

This repository implements a scalable data engineering workflow for Netflix data. It includes pipeline definitions, dataset schemas, linked service configurations, and transformation notebooks.

It is designed to help you process raw Netflix streaming data, transform it into clean structured layers (Silver/Gold), and prepare analytics for dashboards, BI tools, or machine learning models.

Key Concepts

Ingestion — Load raw data into a staging layer.

Silver Layer — Clean and standardize data.
Gold Layer — Aggregate and reshape data for analytics.
Orchestration — Automated pipeline runs.
onfig Driven — Everything controlled via config files and linked services.
